                    <p class="blch4p">Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers for every triłing
offense. Ļis retaliation should only be resorted to under peculiarly aggravated
circumstances.</p>

                    <p class="blch4p2">Unlike most novels where the protagonist is an elite demon assassin with hundreds of skills up his sleeve, this one’s quite different. Sung Jin-Woo (From Solo Leveling Novel) is rather an inexperienced and a novice hunter. He barely possesses any skill to withstand a demon in front of him. An E-rank hunter, he struggles to get to the top.</p>

                    <p class="blch5p">In my house, my family only believes in two types of people based on their thinking
and or sexuality; the normal ones, and the abnormal ones. They don’t believe in mental
illnesses such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, etc. They think that these
illnesses are all the same and are under the Filipino word “baliw.”</p>
