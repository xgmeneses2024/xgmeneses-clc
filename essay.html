            <p class="esp">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my house, my family only believes in two types of people based on their thinking
and or sexuality; the normal ones, and the abnormal ones. They don’t believe in mental
illnesses such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, etc. They think that these
illnesses are all the same and are under the Filipino word “baliw.” As their child, they
embedded these in my mind and the same goes for my brother, they will often say “the
people who cut will always be laughed at because they are baliw,” which I thought was
correct back then, but as time passed by I realized how wrong this was.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to PSHS was quite a good choice because I got surrounded by people
who corrected the wrong things my family taught me. I never got bullied in school, but
every time I go back home, everything would be the opposite. My uncles and aunts would
taunt me and point out all my flaws, even those I don’t know of! They often give
compliments then laugh immediately, and I thought they were cheap for giving gifts only
every Christmas but bullying me and my cousins are almost every week. This lead to me
mistaking every compliment I get is an insult. They often make insults of my outfits, I mean
my boots and dress are bad compared to their typical style of shirts and pants wherein
their big fat tummy says hello. I made a coping mechanism of just returning their
“compliments” to me with nicer ones! It surprisingly works because they don’t talk to me
now.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My younger self was quite the dummy back then because she made a mistake
that leads to her losing her phone for two weeks and even earned the title of being the
family’s laughingstock and an example of what not to be. When my mom saw me awake
at maybe one in the morning chatting with my friends just to vent out all my problems, she
told me to stop chatting with them because I am just wasting their time, it made me think
about it and concluded that maybe I’m just a big nuisance to them. So I began distancing
myself from everyone and I continued masking all of my “problems” and I even arrived at
the point where I would just tell myself that I’m worthless and annoying while I cut my
wrist because of my self-hatred. I used to hide it with a watch so people won’t ask or tell
anyone about it, but one time my watch slipped when we were in the Church and my mom
saw. No type of excuse can explain why there is a slit on my wrist and I can’t blame it on
my dog because they would kill her. My mom immediately told me that I’m not depressed
it's just that Satan is whispering to me then she grounded me and proceeded to tell me
how I don’t need any therapist because I only need to pray every hour or so. Wow, it
works I don’t have any slits on my wrists now. Even until now, I am very thankful for my
mom’s advice because I don’t cut on places where people might see, and I still do agree
that I am annoying.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a gay cousin and a lesbian aunt, all I could say is that they’re in the wrong
family. On both my mother’s and father’s side the people there are very homophobic,
transphobic, you name it all, what’s funny is that both sides are very religious, just imagine
praying for peace but then proceeding to invalidate other people because they have a
different gender than you. Both my aunt and cousin got beatings just because of their
gender, if their beating is for their attitude then I would consider it appropriate. The two
were taunted and bullied until my aunt moved away to another province and my cousin
distanced both his parents and the entire family. If God despised everyone who isn't
straight, then why would he want a 10-year-old child to get bullied all of his life? I believe
that their being straight is not a solution, maybe being a mass murderer of their kin is.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my cousins seeked help to the therapists because he acted different
compared to most children of his age, his parents thought he was autistic. When word got
out the child wasn’t spared in the bullyings by our own family. Well that’s one more reason
not to consult anyone about your mental health, because if you seek help, then you would
need to seek more help. To any of us who folds because they can’t take the insults, then
it would be more of a reason to insult you. I mean as the old saying goes, fight fire with
fire.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very thankful to my family because they gave me all sorts of mental illnesses
they don’t know I have because I have been masking for more than 6 years now. To my
cousins who experience the same, just forgive your parents or aunts, uncles for being
childish, and don’t expect them to stop because there is no prayer to healing their level
of “kabaliwan.”
